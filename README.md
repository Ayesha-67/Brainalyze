🧠 Brainlayze – Brain MRI Analysis using FA

Brainlayze is a final year project focused on analyzing Brain MRI scans using Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and image processing techniques to detect abnormalities in white matter regions. The system helps in identifying early signs of neurological disorders through quantitative FA-based analysis and visualization.

🚀 Features

Upload and process Brain MRI scans

Included Neurobot

Calculate Fractional Anisotropy (FA) values

Highlight abnormal regions in white matter

Visualize MRI slices with clear abnormality markers

Simple user interface for interaction and results

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Domain Knowledge: Medical Imaging, Image Processing

📊 Use Cases

Early detection of neurological disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, MS)

Research support for neuroimaging studies

Educational tool for medical imaging students and researchers
