🧠 Brainlayse – Brain MRI Analysis using FA

Brainlayse is a final year project focused on analyzing Brain MRI scans using Fractional Anisotropy (FA) and image processing techniques to detect abnormalities in white matter regions. The system helps in identifying early signs of neurological disorders through quantitative FA-based analysis and visualization.
