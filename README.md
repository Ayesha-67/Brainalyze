# 🧠 Brainlayze – Brain MRI Analysis using FA

Brainlayze is a **final year project** focused on analyzing Brain MRI scans using **Fractional Anisotropy (FA)** and image processing techniques to detect abnormalities in white matter regions.  
The system aims to assist in identifying **early signs of neurological disorders** through quantitative FA-based analysis and visualization.
